### The New Tab System

Work on multiple moodboards and prompt files in one seamless interface. The new tab bar at the top of the application allows you to:

* **Create New Tabs:** Click the icons to add a new `Moodinfinite Board` or a new `Moodprompt File`.
* **Switch Between Projects:** Simply click on a tab to switch to that project.
* **Manage Tabs:**
    * **Rename:** Double-click or right-click a tab to rename it.
    * **Close:** Click the `x` icon to close a tab.
    * **Reorder:** Drag and drop tabs to arrange them in any order you like.


### Introducing: Moodprompt Tabs

**Moodprompt** is a powerful new tool for anyone working with generative AI. Instead of a canvas, this tab type gives you a structured environment to build, test, and organize your prompts.

Each Moodprompt file consists of "Prompt Cards," which feature:

* **Numbered and Reorderable:** Drag and drop cards to organize your workflow.
* **Platform Selector:** Choose the target AI platform (e.g., Midjourney, OpenAI Sora, Kling) to keep your prompts organized.
* **Media Type Toggle:** Switch between `Image` and `Video` prompt types. The video option provides a second image slot for video-to-video prompts.
* **Reference Image Slots:** Upload one or two reference images to associate with your prompt.
* **Dedicated Text Area:** A large text area with a monospace font, perfect for writing and refining complex prompts.
