A simple, no-fuss web application for creating moodboards and basic storyboards. Built with the help of Gemini 2.5 for quick vibe-coding.

Created by me for me and my team but release to everybody.

## Overview

Mood Infinite lets you rapidly assemble visual ideas without the overhead of complex tools. It's designed for creators who want to jump straight into sketching concepts for projects like design, film, or storytelling.

### Key Features
- **Quick Moodboard Creation**: Drag-and-drop images, notes, and colors to build inspiring boards.
- **Storyboard Sketching**: Simple canvas for rough sketches and sequence planning.
- **Minimalist Interface**: No accounts, no installs—just open and create.
- **Export Options**: Save your boards as images or PDFs for sharing.

## Why Mood Infinite?

Existing tools often demand too much setup and hassle. I built this for my own workflow: something lightweight to start a project and move on quickly. Now, it's ready for anyone to create quick moodboards, storyboards, or sketches to kick off visual projects.
