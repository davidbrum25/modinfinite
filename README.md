# Modinfinite
Basic webapp for creating moodboards or basic storyboards.


_**Vibecode** with Gemini 2.5, is just for my basic needs to create quick moodboards and story boards / sketches, to start visual projects.

**List of next features to add:
**
- Auto align on grid with padding, (for multiple selected images).
- Files restrictions to import, (make clear what formats can we import).
- Saving a current moodboard as project not just PNG.
- Snap of a object to another object corners.
